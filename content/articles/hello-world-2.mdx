# Introduction to Next.js and Tailwind CSS

In this article, we'll dive into the basics of Next.js and Tailwind CSS, two popular technologies for building modern web applications.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a powerful React framework that allows developers to build fast and scalable web applications. It offers several key features that make it stand out:

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: Next.js can pre-render pages on the server, improving SEO and performance.
- **Static site generation (SSG)**: Generate static pages at build time for faster load times.
- **API routes**: Build backend APIs within your Next.js app without needing a separate server.

With these features, Next.js simplifies development and enhances the performance of your React applications.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build custom designs without writing custom CSS. Instead of defining styles for specific components, you apply utility classes directly to the HTML elements.

### Benefits of Tailwind CSS:

- **Responsive design**: Tailwind offers built-in classes for handling responsive layouts.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize the default theme to match your branding.
- **Rapid development**: Use utility classes to quickly adjust spacing, colors, typography, and more.

## Setting Up Next.js with Tailwind CSS

To get started with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new Next.js project**:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-next-tailwind-app
   cd my-next-tailwind-app
